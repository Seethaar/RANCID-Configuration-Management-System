This is just to alert you that the SSH keys for the  CPEs listed below got changed possibly due to one of the following reasons:

a) The hardware must have been replaced.
b) SSH keys were generated again on that CPE.
c) Man-In-The-Middle Attack.

Please check the records and related tickets and verify whether a or b was the case. In case of c, please alert your team 
manager immediately.

An automation script on rancid.corpservices.iseek.com.au (/usr/local/bin/automated_ssh_key_del_for_rancid.sh) deleted those 
old keys from /usr/local/rancid/.ssh/known_hosts file, just to save some efforts for NOC personnel to log on to 

rancid.support.com.au

and deleting those keys manually. If this is undesirable, please edit that script accordingly or turn off the cron schedule under 
/etc/cron.d
